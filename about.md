## Passions and Motivators

Even before experience, proficiencies, or technical knowledge, I put forward my passions and motivators as the key to understanding why I excel at what I do. I get excited about people who want to learn, grow, and be challenged; I want to be their teacher and mentor. I love the thrill of solving difficult conundrums by conceptualizing unique and innovative solutions. I work hard to find the root cause of a problem, be it a failure of programming, processes, or people; and I stand out in my skills at finding the path toward continued and lasting success. Monotonous or repetitive tasks present their own challenges that motivate me to create automations and root out inefficiencies. Experimenting and exploring with new and creative technologies and products keeps me enthralled with the application development and developer operations space.

I have built a reputation among my colleagues of trust and honesty, which affords me incredible leeway to pursue much of what I am passionate about. Throughout my career, I have stretched myself and my positions into greater challenges and areas of operation. I have spent years mentoring, teaching, and cultivating the next generation of developers, while still continuing to grow my own career in search of new opportunities. For these reasons, I think I will be an excellent fit for your organization's current needs and future expansion.

<aside class="aside">While I have been exclusively in a Microsoft environment for the last 10+ years professionally, I have started side projects over the years in various other technologies to get an idea of how they approach problems differently. Such projects include using <em>Angular JS</em>, <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, <em>PHP on Zend framework</em>, and <em>VB on legacy ASP.NET</em>.</aside>

## Experience & Responsibilities

### Director of Information Services at _IFCJ_

<aside class="aside"><em>The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews</em> (IFCJ) is a global non-profit with offices in Chicago, Toronto, Brazil, South Korea, and Jerusalem providing humanitarian work in the eastern Mediterranean and former Soviet Union regions of the world. With annual revenue of $120m, IFCJ exists in an operational space with needs that reach into enterprise-level solutions, but within a budget designed to maximize stewardship of our donors' contributions.</aside>

_November 2012 to present_

My time at _The Fellowship_ is highlighted by moments of teaching and mentoring my team; growing and adapting the Information Services department to meet the ever changing needs of the company; and the ongoing work of maintaining and enhancing the custom built donor management system (_KesherNet_). 

Overseeing a team of 3 application developers, 2 database administrators, and a data hygienist, my role is both manager/mentor for the team and the senior technical resource. The department is responsible for ensuring that the organization has timely access to accurate data that is securely stored yet easily accessible. Information is retrieved from dozens of vendors through file imports, API calls, webhooks, and manual keying. The data is accessed by internal users through _KesherNet_, through custom reports, and shared with vendors through file exports.

_KesherNet_ is a web application written in C# on the ASP.NET and EF frameworks connecting to Microsoft SQL Server databases. It includes modules that handle payment processing (CC, ACH, and PayPal), fully templated receipt printing, weekly/monthly/quarterly (and other odd cadence) scheduled gifts, highly adaptable list segmentations, and many other custom tools that support business processes. I was the lead developer on the initial project to build the application, replacing a vendor's legacy system that had reached its end-of-life. I have continued to be the architect and lead developer while teaching and directing junior staff to take on more responsibilities as they learn and grow.

Recent projects include using Azure Functions, CosmosDb, App Services, and API Management to build a donation API for our publicly facing website; implementing code review and check-in policies and governance; and beginning the architecture of a fully cloud-native, open-source donor management solution to replace the current system.

Initial position at _IFCJ_ was as a _Senior .NET Developer_, then after a year was promoted to _.NET Developer Team Lead_. Two years later, promoted to _Manager of Application Development_.

### Application Development Practice Manager at _Falkor Group_

<aside class="aside"><em>Falkor Group</em> is an IT consulting firm specializing in providing managed services, infrastructure support, and applications development for small and mid-sized businesses.</aside>

_May 2006 to November 2012_

Beginning as a junior developer, my initial responsibilities consisted of working within a group of developers collaborating on joint projects. From there I was able to transition from small solo assignments to leading teams of junior developers on larger projects, and within two years had assumed management of the Application Development practice, overseeing a team of five full-time employees and several contractors.

Projects Included:

* Lead Developer on a three year project to convert a large website from classic ASP to ASP.NET Web Forms to support retail franchises for an international tire corporation with product ordering, event scheduling, and to act as an informational hub between the franchises and corporate.
* Developer on a project to analyze and document the business processes for a large humanitarian non-profit, and recommend application solutions to transition their donor management software away from a closed-source Windows forms application.
* Lead Developer on the project to implement the replacement solution for the same large humanitarian non-profit, which included migrating to a new open source platform, and recreating customized business logic in the new system.
* Lead Developer during ongoing maintenance and enhancement projects, also for the same non-profit.
* Sole developer creating a small internal website to aid a rental property management company with data storage, replacing a ten-year-old Access database.
* Created a fully customized internal application for a small community advocacy non-profit on the Chicago south side to manage their client caseload. This replaced an entirely paper-driven workflow with a managed electronic process.

### Additional work experience

* _Best Buy_ (May 2004 - May 2006), Geek Squad "Double Agent"
    * On-premise technical support for home and small businesses.
    * Diagnose and solve problems with home networking, Windows computers, and printers; and provide user training.

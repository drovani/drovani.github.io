<aside style="float: right">
"Rovani in C#" was supposed to be a clever little play on words - obvious but catchy. Maybe it was just lame, but it's simple and it works for me. Of course, that meant I needed to have a catchy little tagline to go with it. So I dutifully pulled the entire list of musical terms, and from that pulled three (it's always three) that seemed like I could make up as something related to what I do.

## Passions and Motivators

Even before experience, proficiencies, or technical knowledge, I look to understand a persons passions and motivators when I need to determine if this is someone I want to work with. I get excited about people who want to learn, grow, and be challenged; I want to be their teacher and mentor. I love the thrill of solving difficult problems but conceptualizing unique and innovative solutions. I work hard to find the root cause of a problem, be it a failure of a person, a process, or a program; and I excel in finding the path toward continued and lasting success. I easily grow bored with monotonous or repetative tasks, but that motivates me to create automations and root out inefficiences. Experimenting and exploring with new and creative technologies and products keeps me enthralled with the application development and developer operations space.

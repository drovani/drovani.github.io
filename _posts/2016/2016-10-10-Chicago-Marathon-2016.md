For the fourth year in a row, on Columbus Day weekend, I have completed the Bank of America Chicago Marathon. Previous years have culminated in mixed results, both by the clock and in my own experience. 2013's marathon was a disaster in both time and how I felt during the race, but provided me with invaluable experience and a drive to do better. By the time the 2014 Chicago Marathon came around, I had taken up speed training with [Coach Leach](http://coachleach.com/), focused a little more on my running form, and put together a strong showing at the 2014 F3 Half Marathon. However, during last year's race, I had set unrealistic expectations, especially while trying to run with a sore back. 2015 was not a good year for me, overall - but I was determined to turn things around for 2016.

### Looking Back at 2016

A lot of dark things happened in my personal life in 2015; but by early 2016, I had started on a recovery course, and I was determined to make 2016 a year of stabilizing my life and pushing forward on my career, my personal life, and my running. The year started with a trip to Disney for the Dopey Challenge[^dopey]

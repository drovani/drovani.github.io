I just can't seem to manage consistently planning meals for two weeks in a row. This last week, however, was probably my best non-planned out week of meals. Several of the meals were either leftovers of meals or used the uncooked protein from meals from the prior week. For example, I did a pot roast stew on Tuesday night in the slow cooker using the portion of the beef that I didn't use from the Beef Stroganoff.

What's In The Refrigerator

- Brussels sprouts - three cut containers

- Tortillas
- Hamburger bun (yes, just one)
- English muffins
- Naan

- Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (frozen, running low)
- Steak (frozen), probably filet mignons, individually wrapped
- Boneless Pork chops (defrosting)
- Shrimp (frozen bag)

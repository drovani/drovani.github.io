In the spirit of trying new things for the new year (and being desperate to prevent injury this year), I am going to do 30 burpees every day. I stumbled on a [Runner's World article][1] where the author talks about her progression over the course of 15 days. I will be using her description of the burpee (squat, kick-out, pushup, squat, jump). I know there are many variations, but I can do 30 pushups and I can do 30 squats, so now it's just the dreaded part of putting it with the kickouts. I like that she progressed from 3 sets of 10 burpees with a one minute rest, then dropped 15 seconds of rest every three days.

For reference this will be my schedule:
- Jan 3: 10 burpees, 1 min rest, 10 burpees, 1 min rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 4: 10 burpees, 1 min rest, 10 burpees, 1 min rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 5: 10 burpees, 1 min rest, 10 burpees, 1 min rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 6: 10 burpees, 45 sec rest, 10 burpees, 45 sec rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 7: 10 burpees, 45 sec rest, 10 burpees, 45 sec rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 8: 10 burpees, 45 sec rest, 10 burpees, 45 sec rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 9: 10 burpees, 30 sec rest, 10 burpees, 30 sec rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 10: 10 burpees, 30 sec rest, 10 burpees, 30 sec rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 11: 10 burpees, 30 sec rest, 10 burpees, 30 sec rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 12: 10 burpees, 15 sec rest, 10 burpees, 15 sec rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 13: 10 burpees, 15 sec rest, 10 burpees, 15 sec rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 14: 10 burpees, 15 sec rest, 10 burpees, 15 sec rest, 10 burpees
- Jan 15: 30 burpees

If I can continue this until the end of the month, I'll explore adding something more to this. But for now, it's day 1 of this self-imposed challenge, and we'll see how long it lasts.

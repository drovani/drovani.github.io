[![N1400 for June 11th and 13th]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2019-06-15-n1400.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl}}/No-Easy-Runs)

The first week of the <abbr title="Chicago Area Runners Association">CARA</abbr> summer marathon training is now in the books, and I am still trying to figure out how to best plan my running schedule. Because of schedule limitations (having three kids will do that), I can only really run on Tuesday and Thursday mornings by myself and Saturday mornings with the running group. In previous years, I would do one or two hard days (tempo or speed workouts) and then two or three days of easier runs, with a long run on Saturdays; this year, I have to limit it to just two days of runs plus weekend long runs.

In order to make the most of my time, I roll my Tuesday/Thursday morning runs into my commute. At the shortest, it is an 8 mile run though my typical route will be 9.6 miles.

[![N1400 for June 11th and 13th]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2019-06-15-n1400.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl}}/No-Easy-Runs)

The first week of the <abbr title="Chicago Area Runners Association">CARA</abbr> summer marathon training is now in the books, and I am still trying to figure out how to best plan my running schedule. Because of schedule limitations (having three kids will do that), I can only really run on Tuesday and Thursday mornings by myself and Saturday mornings with the running group. In previous years, I would do one or two hard days (tempo or speed workouts) and then two or three days of easier runs, with a long run on Saturdays; this year, I have to limit it to just two days of runs plus weekend long runs.

In order to make the most of my time, I roll my Tuesday/Thursday morning runs into my commute. At the shortest, it is an 8 mile run though my typical route will be 9.6 miles.

## Two Months Later

This post has been sitting in a draft status for two months. I'm just going to publish it so I can find the information later.

Training hasn't been as regular as I was hoping for. There have been two weeks, already, where I wasn't able to get in any mid-week runs, and just this last week, I was only able to do one of my runs. It requires a lot more coordination than I thought it would to get work clothes and meals downtown, ensure I don't need to bring my work computer home, and get to bed at a decent enough hour that I'm not dead in the morning. 4:00 alarms are an absolute nightmare when your baby wakes up every two hours during the night.

While I had the best 20 miler I've had in years last week, I'm still not confident at all that next week's [Ready 2 Run](https://www.carareadytorun.com/) is going to be a successful run. Last year, I barely made it 18 miles pacing the 7:30/mile group. If I can make it all 20 miles, I'll feel really good heading into the final taper weeks before the marathon. Otherwise, it's been my experience that a terrible R2R leads to a mediocre Chicago Marathon (at best).

I have migrated my blog from the old hosted Wordpress site that I was using to be hosted by GitHub pages, powered by Jekyll.

Why, you might ask. Because I can.

Also, because I want to use my domain to host this, and I _think_ that I can do that with Google Domains and this site. We'll see how that works out.

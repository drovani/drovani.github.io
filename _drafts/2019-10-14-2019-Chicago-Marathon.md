All things considered, I am content with my performance at the 42nd running of the Bank of America Chicago Marathon. I had been battling a nasty couch all week, I wasn't able to train as hard as I initially hoped, and the weather was veryh windy. While I came no where close to hitting my Boston Qualifying time, I did manage to improve on my personal record. Finishing at 03:15:36, it beats my previous best by 01:39. By the time next year's Chicago Marathon comes around, I'll only need to lower my PR by six or seven minutes in order to get through to Boston.

## The Night Before And Morning Of

I am constantly forgetting to create a night-before packing list, so hopefully I'll remember in the future that I have done so here and maybe I'll revise this list, or correct it as-needed and repost it with the next race.

- **Packed Into Backpack**
    - Pre-race Supplies: glasses case, contacts, Glide stick
    - Corral+Race Clothes: shirt (bib already attached), socks, visor, sunglasses (shaded and yellow pairs), old socks (for hand warming)
    - Race Gear: HR band & monitor, gel/nutrient bars, ziplock bag (for phone)
    - Post-race Clothes: compression socks, boxers
    - Battery & cable for phone
    - Race shoes
- **Prepare for Morning**
    - Razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, towel
    - Laid out to wear: Running shorts, warm pants, warm shirt, socks, jacket, walking shoes
    - Queue coffee pot
- **Morning-Of Task List**
    - Shave, shower, brush teeth, get dressed
    - Fill coffee thermos, pack into backpack
    - Toast bread, add almond butter & banana
    - Depart house, eating breakfast while walking

This was the first time departing the new house for a race, so I had a little trepidation about getting downtown. The Brown Line doesn't start running until 5:00, meaning I wasn't going to arrive at the CARA VIP Experience until 5:45. This turned out to be just fine - I get nervous about these things.

So I left my house at 4:45, got to the Rockwell platform with plenty of time to spare, rode the train to Adams/Wabash, and walked the half-block to the Palmer House. The CARA compound was a friendly as ever - lots of familiar faces in various states of wakefulness. I was among those still waking up. Coffee was helping, but slowly.

I remembered to pack nearly everything I needed (I forgot an old pair of socks as hand warmers). I went about my routine of slowly getting into corral+race gear.

## Pre-Race Routine

The only race gear that I put on at home are my running shorts, and I wear my throw-away shirt and post-race pants while getting to the race. At the compound, I'll change into the rest of my race gear, swing by the bathroom to apply Glide, and then drop off the backpack at gear check. From there, it is a short walk to the CARA VIP Port-a-potties (the closest bathrooms to the start line without having to worry about access to the race's blue boxes).

This year, I departed earlier than I needed to. Security lines are such a crap-shoot that I feel like a five minute difference in departure time means a 20+ minute wait in the security line. I was smart, this year, by going to one of the later gates that was further away from the Wave 1 gates. There was already a line near Gate 1, but there was absolutely no line at Gate 4 - which also happened to be right by the CARA Ports. Definitely a double-win.

The morning was quite chilly, roughly 39&deg;F (3.8&deg;C).

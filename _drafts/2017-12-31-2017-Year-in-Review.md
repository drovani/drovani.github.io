Last night, while sitting on a hotel bed in the middle of nowhere Ohio, I banged out 500 words about nothing. It wasn't a glorious piece of writing, but it was something. Throughout that piece, I kept thinking about how I consistenly wish I would write more often. Before I blew up my previous laptop, I had about a half-dozen uncommitted drafts of pieces that I started writing but never actually went anywhere with. Looking back on the year, I feel as if 2017 has been my worst year for uncompleted projects; or even worse, for unexecuted projects.

Including this post, I'll have added sixteen entries to my website over the course of the year. It's about as many as I assembled last year, but still far short of the one-per-week that I really would have liked.

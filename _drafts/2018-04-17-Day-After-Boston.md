It's the day after the 2018 Boston Marathon, the 122nd running of the race. This is also the third year in a row where fellow runners that I trained with have gone to the race for their first time. There are 173 days until the Chicago Marathon This is also the second Spring in a row where I have had to cancel my Spring race plans because of injury. I need to do something new, and part of that is going to be getting into the habit of a daily exercise routine. I am starting with some simple stretches and stengthening exercises that should take about a half hour.

## Injury Update

- My back has been keeping me up for half the night as of late. A pair of ibuprofen lets me sleep, but as soon as that wears off, I am awake &mdash; often debating whether to pop two more pills, or just get up and start my day. Typically, if I have made it past 4:00, I figure it is a waste to try and go back to sleep.

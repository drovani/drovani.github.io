## Passions and Motivators

Even before experience, proficiencies, or technical knowledge, I put forward my passions and motivators as the key to understanding why I excel at what I do. I get excited about people who want to learn, grow, and be challenged; I want to be their teacher and mentor. I love the thrill of solving difficult conundrums by conceptualizing unique and innovative solutions. I work hard to find the root cause of a problem, be it a failure of programming, processes, or people; and I stand out in my skills at finding the path toward continued and lasting success. Monotonous or repetitive tasks present their own challenges that motivate me to create automations and root out inefficiencies. Experimenting and exploring with new and creative technologies and products keeps me enthralled with the application development and developer operations space.

I have built a reputation among my colleagues of trust and honesty, which affords me incredible leeway to pursue much of what I am passionate about. Throughout my career, I have stretched myself and my positions to the point where there is no more room for me to grow or new challenges that await me. I have spent years mentoring, teaching, and cultivating the next wave of developers; these developers are now ready to step into larger roles with expanded responsibilities. When this happens, it becomes time for me to seek out new opportunities to learn, new teams of peers to grow with, and to uplift another group of developers.

## Proficiencies & Technical Knowledge

While I have been exclusively in a Microsoft environment for the last 10+ years professionally, I have started side projects over the years in various other languages to get an idea of how they approach problems differently. Such languages include Ruby on Rails, PHP on Zend framework, and VB on legacy ASP.NET.

<blockquote>When you have children, you can have exactly one hobby. Anything else is an exercise in futility, self-deception, and ineffectiveness. Cooking healthy food is a hobby. Exercising is a hobby. Maintaining a website is a hobby. Writing a blog is a hobby. Bringing work home is a hobby.</blockquote>

I wrote more about this in the post titled <a href="/Exactly-One-Hobby">Exactly One Hobby</a>, and all of my running posts are gathered under this category.

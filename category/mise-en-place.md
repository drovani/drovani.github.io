Inspired by the book <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/284027/work-clean/">"Work Clean: The life-changing power of mise-en-place to organize your life, work, and mind"</a>, I am attempting to put a little more order in my life. This project started as simply planning out my meals for the week, and morphed into planning out my tasks for today, tomorrow, _soon_, and _later_.

Inspired by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj554200.aspx">CQRS Journey</a> that a team at Microsoft made in 2012, I felt that posting a series of pieces about the steps that I was taking while creating this large project would provide three key benefits. First, it would give me something to write about. I have tried keeping blogs before, but I fail after a few months to generate content. Second, by having to describe everything, it forces me to have to rationalize all design and development decisions. Sure, I'm just having to rationalize them to myself, but frequently, I am my own worst critic. Finally, it give me motivation to keep working on the progress instead of getting bored with it and not trying to find some way to reinvigorate my enthusiasm.

I have no idea where this is going to take me, but I am excited to see what happens.

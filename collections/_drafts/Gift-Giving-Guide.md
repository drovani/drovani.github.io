Another gift giving season has come and gone, and I find myself pretending to enjoy some gifts; genuinely enjoying other gifts; and unsure about the rest. However, I have discovered that there are classes of gifts that are just not for me. While it may be well intentioned to buy me a gift - I figure it can't hurt to put forth some guidelines for getting me the perfect gift.

First - buy something from my [Amazon list][1]. I know it can be boring to just buy something off a list, but I keep it up to date. Come August or after Thanksgiving, I won't buy myself anything that is on that list. Frequently, though, anything leftover on the list after the season is over, I will just buy on my own - especially if it is something that I can convince myself that I _need_.

Second - buy something consumable. I have almost all of the essentials that I need in life, and most things that I would want that aren't on my list are too expensive to be worth putting on the list. Bottles of wine, apertifs, beer, and grappa are all good bets - or really anything alcoholic. Food is usually good, unless I'm doing one of my restrictive eating plans. Gift cards to popular stores will also work in a pinch. Sugary things (candy, chocolates, sports drinks) are best given to someone else.

Third - kitchen supplies, tools, or electronics are very difficult to get right. Ask any cook, workman, or nerd and they will tell you that when they want something, they want a very specific thing. I'm not going to ask for "a laptop". I am going to want an exact model with an exact set of features. If it comes to something in the kitchen, I have a very particular set of tools that I use regularly and I know exactly where the gaps are. If this is the category that you really want to give a meaningful gift to me - please ask my wife, first. If she doesn't know, she is very good at finding subtle ways of bringing it up in conversation and getting the answer she needs. I swear, it's her superpower. She has nailed it on every gift giving occasion, and she's the only one batting 1.000. She plays a dangerous game giving from this category, but she's really good at it. Thus, if you don't want to give from a list or give a consumable, run your idea by her before you buy something.

Fourth - clothing. The short of it - don't even try. I have a small closet, a very picky sense of fashion, and a body type that is awful to try and find something that fits perfectly. If you do manage to find something that you know will fit, please (pretty, pretty please) don't buy me something with a logo, saying, graphic print, or other "fun" thing on it. I like simple, comfortable, perfectly fitting clothes. **I** have an impossible time finding stuff that fits; please don't try to find something that fits me, too. And of course - if you manage to, I have enough running shirts (short and long sleeves), running shorts, running tights, running socks, dress socks, sweatshirts, hoodies, and jackets to last me a very long time. I don't want any more.

Fifth - interior decorations. I don't want more stuff to put on shelves or walls. Please - no more posters, figurines, memorabilia, sentimental decorations, magnetic sayings, keychains, or nearly anything else that might be labelled as "cute." It's not my style, and I will begrudingly display it out of a sense of obligation, but it will eternally remind me how much I hate clutter.

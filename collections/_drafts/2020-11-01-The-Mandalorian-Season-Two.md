I enjoyed jotting down my thoughts while watching Season One of _The Mandalorian_, so I'll keep doing that for this second season. I'm sure no one appreciates what I have to say, but at least I'm entertained by it.

## Chapter 9: I Can't Marshall Any New Cute Names

- Whistling birds! Have you not heard of his birdies?
- I guess there are like five planets worth putting plot elements on?
- The puppy-ears look got a chuckle out of me.
- A gunslinger rides into a small backwater down in the dessert, parks outside the local cantina, and walks up to the barkeep.
- This whole show is made infinitely better with the presence of Timothy Olyphant. (say "it was justified" say it say it say it!)
- Quickdraw, quickdraw, please do a quickdraw... YES! That's the Timothy Olyphant gunslinger we all know and love.
- We just saw in the flashback that he used the sights on his helmet to fire the missile; but now he doesn't have his helmet. What if he needs to fire the missile?
- The Replacements - I want to do a whole spoof take on using these townspeople as a replacement set of townspeople because the regular townspeople are on strike and the governor wants to carry out the season without dealing with regulars.
- I bet it eats a bantha steed with all the explosives.
- Acid spittle! I'll be that's miserable.
- Never believe it's dead on the first attempt.
- I was definitely expecting an epic bass recorder hit when Mando came flying out of the krayt dragon.

## Chapter 10: Oh, the passenger / She rides and she rides

- I have a unique idea for an opening shot - wide open dessert, the hero riding towards the camera on his steed, dust flowing behind him.
- And hijinx ensure... that's how the plot was pitched.
- If this cargo is so damn precious, why isn't it strapped down?
- So you're saying that through all the steering and banking, nothing fell, but a little hole in the wall and all of the cargo suddenly falls to the ground?
- I find it hard to believe that this mother isn't FUCKING LIVID that there are missing eggs. There aren't enough in the tank to not notice that multiple are gone.
- How many times does The Kid point out something that turns out to be irrelevant? Because so far, the plot has shown that anytime The Kid points, the Mandalorian should take heed. So why does he keep telling The Kid to piss-off?
- Face huggers? Is this an Alien/Star Wars cross-over event?
- The nice part about sublight, I guess, is that you an just point your ship and fire... and it'll coast to where you need to go.
- That's the end of the episode? That felt extraordinarily short. New content started at 00:01:43 and the show was over at 00:36:55; 00:35:12 for a show of this magnitude seems sorely lacking.

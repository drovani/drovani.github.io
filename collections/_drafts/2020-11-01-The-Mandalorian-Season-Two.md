I enjoyed jotting down my thoughts while watching Season One of _The Mandalorian_, so I'll keep doing that for this second season. I'm sure no one appreciates what I have to say, but at least I'm entertained by it.

## Chapter 9: I Can't Marshall Any New Cute Names

- Whistling birds! Have you not heard of his birdies?
- I guess there are like five planets worth putting plot elements on?
- The puppy-ears look got a chuckle out of me.
- A gunslinger rides into a small backwater down in the dessert, parks outside the local cantina, and walks up to the barkeep.
- This whole show is made infinitely better with the presence of Timothy Olyphant. (say "it was justified" say it say it say it!)
- Quickdraw, quickdraw, please do a quickdraw... YES! That's the Timothy Olyphant gunslinger we all know and love.
- We just saw in the flashback that he used the sights on his helmet to fire the missile; but now he doesn't have his helmet. What if he needs to fire the missile?
- The Replacements - I want to do a whole spoof take on using these townspeople as a replacement set of townspeople because the regular townspeople are on strike and the governor wants to carry out the season without dealing with regulars.
- I bet it eats a bantha steed with all the explosives.
- Acid spittle! I'll be that's miserable.
- Never believe it's dead on the first attempt.
- I was definitely expecting an epic bass recorder hit when Mando came flying out of the krayt dragon.

## Chapter 10: Oh, the passenger / She rides and she rides

- I have a unique idea for an opening shot - wide open dessert, the hero riding towards the camera on his steed, dust flowing behind him.
- And hijinx ensure... that's how the plot was pitched.
- If this cargo is so damn precious, why isn't it strapped down?
- So you're saying that through all the steering and banking, nothing fell, but a little hole in the wall and all of the cargo suddenly falls to the ground?
- I find it hard to believe that this mother isn't FUCKING LIVID that there are missing eggs. There aren't enough in the tank to not notice that multiple are gone.
- How many times does The Kid point out something that turns out to be irrelevant? Because so far, the plot has shown that anytime The Kid points, the Mandalorian should take heed. So why does he keep telling The Kid to piss-off?
- Face huggers? Is this an Alien/Star Wars cross-over event?
- The nice part about sublight, I guess, is that you can just point your ship and fire... and it'll coast to where you need to go.
- That's the end of the episode? That felt extraordinarily short. New content started at 00:01:43 and the show was over at 00:36:55; 00:35:12 for a show of this magnitude seems sorely lacking.

## Chapter 11: The Heiress

- "It might get a little choppy", famous last words. The problem with forboding messages about possibility of death to the titular character is that there is no suspense to the audience that it might actually be fatal.
- The "Marco Polo" of this reptilian alien race?
- Katee Sackhoff is always a win.
- Mandalorian sects add a lot of potential depth to this whole series.
- "Do you see that ship that we are all looking at and is framed in the shot? That's what we're going to talk about."
- "Can I leave him with you a bit?" You know, the child that ate several of your eggs, can you hang out with him for a bit. I still don't see how these parents aren't really upset about that.
- Why don't you start with all of the doors being closed? hahahaha... ok, that was fantastic
- Am I really just watching a live stream of Mandalorian the RPG? The quest text from Bo-Katan was as exactly the gibberish you'd get from an exclamation point. And all that matters is where the directional arrow points to.
- Another disappointingly short episode. Less than 30 minutes.

## Chapter 12: The Seige

- In which I really just hope there's more Katee Sackhoff, or maybe even some more Giancarlo Esposito.
- The statue of the attack robot is a fantastic touch!
- This guy shows no aptitude for this mission, yet they bring him in on a whim, and just to do the most important part? This seems like a terrible way to do a set-up on the plot.
- The acting and action in this scene at the top of the base is ridiculously awful. It's a terrible, cartoonish spectacle without any redeeming humor or novel sequences. It's just bad television.
- What's the point in red-target lock if it doesn't actually mean an instant hit?
- How does his ship get repaired that quickly? It's been hours at best, definitely not even a full day.

## Chapter 13:

- In which I really, really hope there's more Katee Sackhoff.
- Episode starts 00:01:48 in. This isn't a hopeful sign.
- White beam lightsabers?! A unique set of action sequences! This is what I came here for.
- What's the point in heavily fortified walls when there are jetpacks and spaceships that can easily circumvent the walls?
- Well... the kid has a name. I'm curious what committee of writers it took to come up with that name.
- What idiot of an evil villian leaves her guards behind and leaves herself unprotected?
- Grand Admiral Thron? Why do I care about this person?
- Cool... cool... another "go here, find this, do that" quest.

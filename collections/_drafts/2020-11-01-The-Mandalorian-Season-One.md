I enjoyed jotting down my thoughts while watching Season One of _The Mandalorian_, so I'll keep doing that for this second season. I'm sure no one appreciates what I have to say, but at least I'm entertained by it.

## Chapter 9: I Can't Marshall Any New Cute Names

- Whistling birds! Have you not heard of his birdies?
- I guess there are like five planets worth putting plot elements on?
- The puppy-ears look got a chuckle out of me.
- A gunslinger rides into a small backwater down in the dessert, parks outside the local cantina, and walks up to the barkeep.
- This whole show is made infinitely better with the presence of Timothy Olyphant. (say "it was justified" say it say it say it!)
- Quickdraw, quickdraw, please do a quickdraw... YES! That's the Timothy Olyphant gunslinger we all know and love.
- We just saw in the flashback that he used the sights on his helmet to fire the missile; but now he doesn't have his helmet. What if he needs to fire the missile?
- The Replacements - I want to do a whole spoof take on using these townspeople as a replacement set of townspeople because the regular townspeople are on strike and the governor wants to carry out the season without dealing with regulars.
- I bet it eats a bantha steed with all the explosives.
- Acid spittle! I'll be that's miserable.
- Never believe it's dead on the first attempt.
- I was definitely expecting an epic bass recorder hit when Mando came flying out of the krayt dragon.

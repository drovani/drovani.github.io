title: Another Year In Review - 2020
category: "Rovani in C&sharp;"
---

Another year has come and gone, and its another year with lofty goals that fell well short of what I had hoped. This seems to be a common theme at the end of each calendar. There's probably a lesson to be learned there, though I doubt I'll carry that into the new year. I have already started thinking about what things I want to do in 2021, which makes it tough to look back and see what this last year was. I have found, though, that these posts have become a journal of sorts. I occasionally go back and reread my chronicles from years past, just to remind myself of what it was like. Perhaps sometime in the future, my kids will read through this and see what happened while they were growing up.

## The Global Pandemic

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This year, life should be a little more stable, which will hopefully include a steady schedule. Consistent calendars mean I can plan runs, meals, and recovery further in advance, which leads to stability, which is huge for me for mental health.</p>&mdash; David Rovani (@davidrovani) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidrovani/status/1212789338553098241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There is no way around it - the global COVID-19 pandemic shaped everything in 2020. My work schedule, the kids' lives, the projects taken on, the goals unmet, and the races not run. Everyone's lives were radically changed by the unexpected office closures, business lockdowns, and forced remote-school. Even with the talk of "going back to normal" one there is wide distribution of the vaccine, I can't even fathom anymore what that means. I just don't see losing this freedom of working whatever hours are convenient and the flexibility to take care of my family when necessary. While there is still the appeal of seeing coworkers in person and getting that physical interaction, the is nothing enticing about commuting to an office five days a week to just sit in a chair and work on the same hardware that I have at home. But on the other hand, having forty-five minutes before work and forty-five minutes after work to just decompress and separate work and home life... but on the other, other hand, not getting to drop the kids off at school in the morning, and losing that contact with them... but back to the first hand...

And that's how it has been for me as we think about what the future of office work looks like.

## Fitness Goals

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">S.M.A.R.T. Goal #2: earn 1300 MEPs (MyZone exercise points) every month. Yesterday&#39;s 10k run netted me 206 MEPs (15.8% of monthly goal!). Conservatively, that&#39;s 200 MEPs per 90min of real time (includes prep, run, recovery, shower), or 9.75 hours/month. Very reasonable.</p>&mdash; David Rovani (@davidrovani) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidrovani/status/1212789341778513922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### The Marathon That Didn't Mean Anything, And Was All The Better For It

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2020 Chicago race applies to Boston 2022, where I&#39;ll be 40 years old. 03:10:00 BQ means 03:05:00 goal time - a little more than 10 minutes off my current PR. Doable, but it is going to be a lot of work. &quot;Run More&quot;, as such, needs to be about running smarter, not just more miles.</p>&mdash; David Rovani (@davidrovani) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidrovani/status/1212789340201467910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
